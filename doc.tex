\section{Introduction}
The standard method for characterization of any material's crystalline structure is X-ray diffraction, also known as XRD.
By studying how the X-rays reflects from the crystalline material, one can get an understanding of the material's properties and structure.

In this laboratory we are faced with two main tasks.
Firstly, to compute the wavelength ($\lambda$) of the X-rays, by measuring the diffraction behavior of NaCl and comparing it to our theoretically calculated values.
Secondly, for four samples, labled A, B, C and D, determine either the material in question or the orientation of the crystal plane of said material.

\section{Experiment procedure}
\subsection{$\boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{-}\boldsymbol{2}\boldsymbol{\beta}$ scan}
We can describe the reflection of an X-ray beam by treating it as specular (mirrorlike) and assuming elastic scattering. From these premises we can find Bragg's law
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:braggs}
    2 \cdot d(hkl) \cdot sin( \theta ) = \lambda
\end{equation}

$d(hkl)$ is the distance between parallel lattice planes of the configuration $(hkl)$
characterizing the reciprocal lattice vector $\bold{G}=\frac{2\pi}{a}(h,k,l)$, where $a$ is the lattice constant.
$d(hkl)$ can be shown to be equal to $\frac{2\pi}{\abs{\bold{G}}} = \frac{2\pi}{a}\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}$.
In this laboratory we use a $\beta-2\beta$ scan, also known as coupled mode.
The incident beam hits the sample at an angle $\beta$, which is the same as the angle of the reflecting beam.
This is done by rotating the sample to an angle $\beta$ and subsequently moving the detector to an angle of $2\beta$, as shown in figure 1.

\image{uppstallning}{The $\beta-2\beta$ scan setup and visualization of corresponding wave vector in reciprocal space}
The scattering vector $\bold{q}$ equals to the difference between the outgoing and incoming wavevectors,
$\bold{k}' - \bold{k}$. By equation (20) in chapter 2 from \cite{Kittel} the scattering
amplitude $F$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:scatamp}
    F = \sum_\bold{G} \int dV n_{\bold{G}} e^{i(\bold{G}-\bold{q})\cdot r}
\end{equation}

When the scattering vector equals a particular reciprocal lattice vector, $\bold{q} = \bold{G}$, the intensity of the reflection will peak in the diffractogram. 


In bounded mode the scattering vector $\bold{q}$ is altered only by the single angle $\beta$.
The length of the scattering vector can be determined from figure 1 as $\abs{\bold{q}} = 2 \abs{\bold{k}} sin(\beta)$.
This means that $\bold{q}$ is bounded by $2 \abs{\bold{k}} sin(\beta_min) < \abs{\bold{q}} < 2 \abs{\bold{k}} sin(\beta_max)$.
A great limitation is furthermore that in coupled mode, only beams reflected off planes with normals perpendicular to the scattering vector might be measured by the detector. The covered space of the reciprocal space is therefore only a limited curve.


\subsection{Structure factors}
The second condition for a diffraction peak to appear is that the structure factor must be nonzero.
The structure factor $S_{\bold{G}}$ of a crystal structure can be calculated as below. Here $n$ is the number of atoms in the basic lattice, and atom $j$ is at position $\bold{r}_j$ with atomic form factor $f_j$. The atomic form factors are approximately equal to the atomic number.\\
\begin{equation}
    S_{\bold{G}} = \sum^n_{j=1} f_j e^{-i \left( \bold{r}_j \cdot \bold{G}\right)}
\end{equation}

Say $\bold{G} = \frac{2\pi}{a}\left( h,k,l \right)$. The structure factor of an fcc lattice with lattice constant $a$ is
\begin{equation}
    S^{fcc}_{\bold{G}} = f\cdot \left[ 1 + (-1)^{h+k} + (-1)^{k+l} + (-1)^{l+h}\right]
\end{equation}
The fcc structure factor is nonzero if and only if $h$, $k$ and $l$ are all even or all odd.\\

\subsubsection{NaCl}
The two atoms in the conventional cell of NaCl, one Na and one Cl, are each in an fcc structure.
Putting an Na at the origin, the Cl structure will be displaced by $\frac{a}{2}\bold{e}_x$.
The structure factor sums can then be expressed using the fcc structure factor above as
\begin{align}
    S^{NaCl}_{\bold{G}}
    &= \left( f_{Na} + f_{Cl}e^{2\pi i\cdot \frac{h}{2}} \right) \cdot \left[ 1 + (-1)^{h+k} + (-1)^{k+l} + (-1)^{l+h}\right]\nonumber\\
    &= \left( f_{Na} + f_{Cl}(-1)^{h} \right) \cdot S^{fcc}_{\bold{G}}
\end{align}\label{naclstructure}
With $f_{Na}=11$ and $f_{Cl}=17$ the structure factor will only be $0$ when the fcc part is $0$.

\subsubsection{Si}
Silicon is monoatomic with two atoms in the conventional cell, at $(0,0,0)$ and at $a(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4})$.
The structure factor becomes

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sistructure}
    S^{Si}_{\bold{G}}
    = f_{Si}\cdot \left( 1 + e^{\pi i \frac{h+k+l}{2}} \right) \cdot S^{fcc}_{\bold{G}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{GaAs and InP}\\
The other two crystals in this lab both have a zincblende structure with two different atomic factors , say $f_\alpha,f_\beta$.
The $\alpha$-atoms are in an fcc structure starting at the origin and the $\beta$-atoms are displaced by $\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{4}$, again in a cubic fcc structure.
The structure factor becomes

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:zincblendestructure}
    S^{\alpha\beta}_{\bold{G}}
    = \left( f_\alpha + f_\beta e^{\pi i \frac{h+k+l}{2}} \right) \cdot S^{fcc}_{\bold{G}}
\end{equation}

The atomic form factors are $f_{Ga}=31$, $f_{As}=33$, $f_{In}=49$ and $f_{P}=15$.
The structure factor for InP is only zero if and only if the fcc structure factor is zero.
The same goes for GaAs, except when $h+k+l\equiv_4 2$ the structure factor becomes small which might affect the diffraction peaks.

\section{Discussion of the results}
\subsection{Finding the X-ray wavelength from the NaCl diffraction pattern}
The crystal surface is cut parallel to the $(1,0,0)$ lattice plane.
In coupled mode the $hkl$-vectors will be integer multiples of this Miller index.
$\bold{G}=\frac{2\pi}{a}(m,0,0)$ where $m$ is an integer.
The structure factor for NaCl is nonzero when $h,k,l$ are all even or all odd.
This happens when $m$ is even.
From \eqref{braggs} our diffraction maxima occurs when
\begin{equation}
\frac{2a}{n}sin\theta=\lambda\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $a=5.63\text{ Å}$.\\
As the (the X-ray wavelength) is constant an increasing angle comes with increasing $m$.
The first maxmimum occurs for $m=2$, the second for $m=4$ et cetera.
Inputting the measured peak angles gives the following values for $\lambda$:\\

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l| }
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Angle}& $m$ & $\lambda$\\
    \hline
    $\beta_1$	& 7.2\degree	& 2	& 0.7056 Å	\\
    $\beta_2$	& 14.5\degree	& 4	& 0.7048	\\
    $\beta_3$	& 22.1\degree	& 6	& 0.7060	\\
	\hline
	\multicolumn{3}{r|}{mean:}	& 0.7055	\\
    \cline{4-4}
\end{tabular}

Given the X-ray wavelength, equation \eqref{braggs} can be used to find the expected angles for different materials and crystal cuts.

\subsection{Determining the material of sample A}

As the crystal sample A is cut with Miller index $(1,1,1)$,
the integer triple $(h,k,l)=m\cdot (1,1,1)$ for integers $m$.

With $\lambda$ in equation \eqref{eq:braggs} known, the equation can be rearranged to find expected angles for the a crystal.
\begin{align}
\label{eq:braggangle}
\theta&=sin^{-1}\left( \frac{\lambda}{2a} \sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}\right)\\
&=sin^{-1}\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}\lambda}{2a} \cdot m\right)\nonumber
\end{align}
Which of these angles give peaks depend on the structure factor of the sample.
For InP the structure factor is always nonzero along this plane - $h,k,l$ always have the same parity.
The structure factor of Si disappears when $h+k+l\equiv_4 2$, which happens for $m=2,6,10,...$.
The expected angles are compared to the experimental measurements in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l|l| }
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\theta_{obs}$}
	& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{InP}
	& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Si}\\
    \hline
	\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Angle}& $m$ & $\theta$ & $m$ & $\theta$ \\
	\hline
    $\beta_1$	& 6.5\degree	& 1 & 5.9745\degree & 1	& 6.4606\degree	\\
    $\beta_2$	& 19.8\degree	& 2 & 12.015\degree & 3	& 19.728\degree	\\
    $\beta_3$	& 26.9\degree	& 3 & 18.195\degree & 4	& 26.749\degree	\\
    $\beta_4$	& 34.4\degree	& 4 & 24.604\degree & 5	& 34.236\degree	\\
    -			& -				& 5 & 31.361\degree & 7	& 51.965\degree	\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

The $m=1,3,4,5$ peaks of Si fit very neatly with the experimental data, while the InP peaks fit much poorly.
Nothing is visible in the data near InP:s $m=2$-peak.
Sample A is cleary Si.

\subsection{Determining the crystal plane of sample B}

Given the material and the wavelength, we can investigate along which plane the crystal was cut.
The crystal is cut along $(1,0,0)$, $(1,1,0)$ or $(1,1,1)$, of which the $(h,k,l)$-vectors are multiples.
giving three different sequences of $h,k,l$-triples allowed by the structure factor.
For example, the $(1,1,0)$-plane gives $\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}=\sqrt{2},\sqrt{4},\sqrt{6}$ et cetera.
The first angles for which the structure factor is nonzero are plotted below.
Theoretical peaks for which the structure factor is almost 0 are within parantheses.

\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c| }
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\theta_{obs}$}
	& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$(m,0,0)$}
	& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$(m,m,0)$}
	& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$(m,m,m)$}\\
    \hline
	\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Angle}& $m$ & $\theta$ & $m$ & $\theta$ & $m$ & $\theta$ \\
	\hline
    $\beta_1$	& 14.7\degree	& (2)	& 7.173\degree & 2	& 10.17\degree & 1	& 6.208\degree	\\
    $\beta_2$	& 30.2\degree	& 4		& 14.46\degree & 4	& 20.68\degree & (2)	& 12.49\degree	\\
    -			& -				& (6)	& 22.00\degree & 6	& 32.00\degree & 3	& 18.93\degree	\\
    -			& -				& 8		& 29.96\degree & 8	& 44.94\degree & 4	& 25.63\degree	\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

The best fit is the $(1,0,0)$-plane. The possible low-intensity peaks for $m=2$, $m=4$ are lost in the measurement noise.
